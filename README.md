# NitroTypeBot
Nitrotype Bot that works!
Steps to use the bot on the bottom:
1. Download a python compiler. I used Idle. Download at https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Go to cmd and download libraries bs4, pynput, and selenium.
Type this in cmd:
  -pip install bs4
  -pip install pynput
  -pip install selenium 
Make sure you downloaded these libraries or else computer will break!
3. Go copy and paste src code into compiler.
4. Go to line 150 and change the numbers inside the randint() to whatever range of speeds you want to race!
5. Don't use your computer and just watch the bot race for you. If you try to control the mouse or controller, bot will crash. 
By using this bot, you are taking responsibility on whatever effects on your Nitro Type account will happen by using the bot.
