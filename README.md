# NitroTypeBot
Nitrotype Bot that works and types for you so that you don't have to type on [Nitrotype](https://www.nitrotype.com)!
Features:
1. A nitrotype bot to play nitrotype for you!
2. A nitrotype account generator to use to type for you on nitrotype!
Steps to use the bot here:
1. Download a python compiler. I prefer Idle. Download at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads)
2. Go to cmd and download libraries bs4, pynput, and selenium.
Type this in cmd: "pip install bs4"
Then, "pip install pynput" 
Finally, "pip install selenium" 
Make sure you downloaded these libraries or else your computer will break!
3. Go copy and paste the [source code](https://github.com/reallyverytrash/NitroTypeBot/blob/master/bot.py) into compiler.
4. Go to line 83 and 85 to put your usename and password into the places where it says
```#Put your usename here```
and 
```#Put your password here```
do not take away the ' ' in the ().
5. Go to line 150 and change the numbers inside the ```randint()``` to whatever range of wpm you want to race! Do not take out the comma. 

# This No Longer Works
If you don't want to use the bot, use this program! Replace speed's value win the speed with ' around it. Replace username's value with username with ' around it. Replace password's value with password with ' around it. This will lower your speed so that you can how much shorter races, causing you to have way more races! Also, you can keep selling the car given to you to get free money.
Just run the [lowerspeed code](https://github.com/reallyverytrash/NitroTypeBot/blob/master/lowerspeed.py)!

**IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT THE BOT**:
By using these programs, you are taking responsibility on whatever effects on your Nitro Type account will happen by using the program. 
There is no way I can steal your account and I simply don't want to. 
Does not work on online compilers! Must use python compilers that are downloaded!
